# 🚀 Space Adventure ([play online](https://aarongarciah.com/space-adventure/))

A simple, mobile friendly game made with [Phaser](http://phaser.io/).

My first game 😁 Work in progress!

## How to play

* Move the spaceship up and down by pressing the screen buttons or presing the up and down arrow keys (only with keyboard).
* Avoid crashing with debris.
* Avoid crashing with the top or the bottom of the screen.
* You can click/tap the asteroids to destroy them.

## TODO

* Improve physics and boundaries of the objects. Probably swith from Arcade Physics to P2.
* Spaceship and crash animations.
* Add terrain to the top and bottom of the screen.
* Save time got by the users and show a ranking.
* Difficulty level selector.
